## Shepherd [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bustlelabs/shepherd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bustlelabs/shepherd) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/shepherd-cli.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/shepherd-cli)

A framework for building applications using AWS API Gateway and Lambda.

Shepherd can also be used just to deploy lambda functions. See the "Using without API Gateway" section for more information.

## Installation

`npm install -g shepherd-cli`

## Quick start

```
> shepherd new
... follow prompts ...
> cd <projet-folder>
> git init
> cp env.js.example env.js
> npm install
> shepherd pull
> shepherd create-function
... follow prompts ...
> shepherd create-resource
... follow prompts ...
> shepherd create-method
... follow prompts ...
> shepherd deploy
... follow prompts ...
```

## Using Without API Gateway

You can use `shepherd` without API gateway if you just need to deploy and version lambda functions. When creating a project use the following command: `shepherd new --no-api`. Your project will now skip any API gateway commands and integrations.

## Opinions

### API Gateway Web UI

It is important to note that this does not yet replace the API Gateway UI. For creating new resources/functions/methods you will want to use the shepherd cli, but edits for headers, params, etc should probably be made through the Web UI. Make sure to update your local api.json file by running `shepherd pull`

### Mapping templates

API Gateway allows you to write "mapping templates" that transform data before sending it to lambda or other backends. They are written in velocity (java templating) and generally not fun to deal with. Shepherd contains a generic template that you should use instead. This is automatically configured for you. Functions generated by shepherd contain ES2015 destructuring that already matches this template. Just use it and save yourself some headache.

Here is an example of the input to lambda:

``` js
{
  headers: {
    Accept: "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8",
    Accept-Encoding: "gzip",
    Accept-Language: "en-US,en;q=0.8",
    Cache-Control: "max-age=0",
    CloudFront-Forwarded-Proto: "https",
    CloudFront-Is-Desktop-Viewer: "true",
    CloudFront-Is-Mobile-Viewer: "false",
    CloudFront-Is-SmartTV-Viewer: "false",
    CloudFront-Is-Tablet-Viewer: "false",
    CloudFront-Viewer-Country: "US",
    DNT: "1",
    Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: "1",
    Via: "1.1 9fab2a39c6d2bda91a3a58e2e1e6133d.cloudfront.net (CloudFront)",
    X-Amz-Cf-Id: "_iTvfyle3-4VqQD3doABOKcjRMq06s1CGQXGTr6LBZB4Wm0i5T2ebg==",
    X-Forwarded-For: "75.151.133.222, 204.246.168.164",
    X-Forwarded-Port: "443",
    X-Forwarded-Proto: "https"
  },
  pathParameters: { },
  queryParameters: { },
  body: { }
}
```

### Lambda versions + API Gateway stages

Shepherd automatically configures proper permissions and links between API Gateway stages and lambda functions. Example: the beta API stage will call the beta version of your lambda functions. Environment variables are contained in `env.js` and copied into your lambda function on deployment. Just add new keys to that file to created additional environments.

### Node Dependencies

Dependencies can be specified for all project functions in your project root `package.json`. These are copied to each function on deployment and overidden by the dependencies in each functions `package.json` file. Essentially each function 'inherits' any production dependencies from the root project.

## Other projects

[Serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless)

Shepherd and Serverless have similar goals. The creation of Shepherd was definitely inspired by Serverless. With Shepherd we strive for a more minimal feature set with more opinions baked in. We encourage you to check out both and select the right one for your project.

[Apex](https://github.com/apex/apex)

Apex is very similar to using Shepherd with the `--no-api` flag. It is just for managing and deploying lambda functions. It also supports multiple lambda runtimes where Shepherd only supports nodejs.

## CLI Commands

`shepherd new` - Creates a new project

`shepherd create-resource` - Creates a new resource

`shepherd create-function` - Creates a new function

`shepherd create-method` - Creates a new method. You should already have created the resource and the function before running this command

`shepherd deploy` - Deploys all functions, sets up permissions+versions, and makes a new API gateway deployment

`shepherd pull` - Pulls a JSON representation of your API and writes it to `api.json`. This is used by shepherd to match up functions with resources and endpoints. If you make changes using the API gateway web UI make sure to pull down those changes by running this command

`shepherd run` - Will run a function using the `development` environment and the event found at `functions/{funcName}/event.json`

## Development

Rebuild on file change: `npm run compile -- -w`
